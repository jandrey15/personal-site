Â¿How does that work?

Require Node.js 8.x

* `yarn install` to install the dependencies
* `yarn run dev` to run development mode app
* `yarn start` to build production

Example [zeit/next](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker)

```shell
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  next-app
```
